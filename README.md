# Snake
An attempt at writing Snake in Processing.JS

# Description
As a little weekend project, I... er... made a version of Snake, then prettied it up just a tad to be able to somehow read it.

For future me:
Here's where we learned to somehow use objects, and our first recursive function.
That is all.
